; ***  BASIC KEY-IN BOOTSTRAP LOADER  ***
; THIS SIMPLE LOADER BOOTSTRAPS IN THE SECOND
; LEVEL BOOTSTRAP, WHICH IN TURN LOADS THE
; REAL PAPER TAPE LOADER.
; TO USE THIS LOADER, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:
; (1) KEY IN THIS LOADER, STARTING AT LOC 1000
; (2) MOUNT THE BOOTSTRAP TAPE, SO THAT
;     THE BLOCK OF RUBOUTS AT THE BEGINNING
;     OF THE TAPE IS IN THE READER
; (3) SET THE PROGRAMMED INPUT SWITCHES TO THE
;     HIGH ORDER 8 BITS OF THE ADDRESS WHERE
;     YOU WANT THE PAPER TAPE LOADER TO
;     BE LOADED. (E.G. TO CAUSE THE LOADER
;     TO BE LOADED AT 5C00, SET THE PROGRAMMED
;     INPUT SWITCHE~ TO 5C.)
; (4) PRESS THE 'RESET' KEY, FOLLOWED BY THE
;     'RUN' KEY, THEN MANUALLY START THE PAPER
;     TAPE READER ON THE TELETYPE.
;
; IF EVERYTHING GOES CORRECTLY, THE LOADER WILL STOP
; THE PAPER TAPE READER, AND PRINT * ON THE
; TELETYPE. AT THIS POINT, MOUNT THE TAPE TO BE
; LOADED IN THE TELETYPE READER, THEN STRIKE ANY KEY
; ON THE TELETYPE. THE LOADER WILL START THE
; PAPER TAPE READER, AND START LOADING THE TAPE. IF
; IT FINDS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TAPE, IT WILL
; STOP THE READER. LOADING MAY BE CONTINUED BY
; STRIKING A KEY ON THE TELETYPE
